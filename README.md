## 👋 Hi, i’m Yasmin ˚.🎀༘⋆

I’m a data enthusiast who loves turning raw data into stories, patterns, and insights that matter 💗
Currently, I’m sharpening my skills in PostgreSQL, Python, R, and Tableau — tools that help me transform messy datasets into something clear and meaningful 🫧✨

📊 From cleaning and processing data to visualizing it in dashboards, i enjoy every step of the process (❀❛ ֊ ❛„)♡
🌱 Still learning, still exploring, and always curious about what else I can build 🧐💻
✨ My goal is simple: keep growing, keep sharing, and one day become a data professional capable of making a significant impact 👩🏻‍💻🔥

💪 Still on my journey, but I’m ready to keep learning, improving, and giving my best! ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧
